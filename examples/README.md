# Vgrid examples

A handful of examples of how to use a couple different visualization formats.
Examples are included for Javascript (for a React app) and Python.
The easiest way to run the Python examples is to put them into a Jupyter
visualization using the [Jupyter widget](https://github.com/scanner-research/vgrid_jupyter).

All examples assume that you have an HTTP server running at port 8000.
The Javascript examples assume the existence of an element in the HTTP with an
id of `vgrid`.
