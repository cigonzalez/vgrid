# VGrid: video metadata visualization in Javascript

VGrid is a Javascript library for visualization spatiotemporal metadata (e.g. bounding boxes, pose keypoints) on video. We use VGrid to inspect and debug computer vision models.

VGrid is a standalone JS library so you can embed it any HTML page. See the [vgrid_jupyter](https://github.com/scanner-research/vgrid_jupyter) package for Jupyter integration.

Documentation coming soon!
